One of the key principles of the NQS is to embed a strong foundation of respect, dignity, equity, diversity, cultural responsiveness, and inclusion in early childhood education and care services (Department of Education, Skills and Employment, 2018). This principle requires early childhood teachers to engage in ongoing cultural competence, communication with families with diverse backgrounds, and continuously reflect on their practices to ensure that they contribute to promoting equity for all children. One of the ways in which the NQS promotes the principle of dignity, equity, diversity, cultural responsiveness, and inclusion is through the requirement for services to develop a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) that acknowledges, respects, and responds to the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These plans provide early childhood teachers with an opportunity to connect with their local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, learn about their local culture, and develop culturally responsive practices that support children’s learning and development. Additionally, the NQS promotes creating and using resources that reflect diversity to support children to develop acceptance and respect of other cultures, which is essential for children's inclusive development in the classroom. Furthermore, the NQS requires services to provide equitable access provisions to all enrolled children, including those with additional needs. It is the responsibility of early childhood teachers to develop strategies that provide all children with access to learning opportunities that meet their unique needs, interests, and abilities. This includes providing resources such as captioning or sign language for children who may be deaf or hard of hearing and personalized learning plans to support children’s different levels, areas of interest, and cultural backgrounds. It is important for early childhood teachers to work collaboratively with families and other educational professionals to create individualized learning plans that meet the needs of each child. In conclusion, the NQS is fundamental in promoting equity, dignity, diversity, cultural responsiveness, and inclusion in early childhood education and care services. Early childhood teachers need to continuously develop their professional practice to meet the NQS requirements, such as engaging in professional learning activities, developing personalized learning plans, and providing inclusive resources. Providing children with enriching experiences across cultures will ultimately result in young children growing up with the understanding of diversity and acceptance, making them culturally-responsive individuals.
