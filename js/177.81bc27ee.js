It is critical for early childhood educators to establish relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities, and respect the historical and cultural diversity of Australian society. Therefore, it is essential to promote awareness among early childhood teachers of the significance of including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures in everyday professional practice. The first standard of the National Quality Framework (NQF) highlights the importance of creating a culturally safe and inclusive learning environment for all children, including those from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Standard 1.2.2 states the importance of respecting and supporting diversity, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures, in early childhood education settings. This creates an opportunity for early childhood educators to build relationships and establish partnerships with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, families, and children. According to the Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) (2021), there are several ways through which early childhood educators can incorporate resoecting and including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures in their daily professional practices. This includes embracing the holistic nature of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, recognising the impact of the land and the environment on children's wellbeing, and being respectful of the cultural beliefs and practices of the local community. Additionally, it involves celebrating cultural events and learnings that relates to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures, and reading about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture to better understand it. Incorporating traditional stories, songs, dance, art, and languages from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures is an excellent way to promote cultural inclusivity in early childhood education. Understanding the significance of Country, Dreaming stories, and traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge, such as plant medicine and environmental practices, is essential for building strong cultural bonds with the children and their families. It is also vital for early childhood educators to create a safe and inviting learning space that represents the diversity and richness of Australian culture, including the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures. In conclusion, early childhood educators play a critical role in promoting inclusivity in their daily professional practices, and respecting and including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures is a key aspect of the National Quality Standards. Through building relationships with communities, learning about diverse cultures, and reflecting on personal biases, early childhood educators can create culturally safe learning environments that benefit all children. The NQS provides a framework for early childhood educators to promote and support cultural diversity, essential for children's cognitive, social, and emotional development.
