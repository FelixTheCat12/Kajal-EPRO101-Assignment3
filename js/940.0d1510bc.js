The NQS sets the benchmark for quality education and care services in Australia, comprising seven quality areas considered fundamental to service provision. One of the core components of the NQS is the focus on developing and implementing educational programs that promote children's learning, which is crucial to ensuring optimal outcomes for children (Department of Education, Skills and Employment, 2019). The implementation of educational programs and practices requires early childhood educators to consider various factors, including cultural diversity, developmental needs of children, engagement with families, and appropriate pedagogical practices. By adhering to the NQS, early childhood educators can establish and maintain high-quality learning environments that promote children's learning and development, meet regulatory requirements, and build positive relationships with families and communities. ACECQA (2021) suggests that early childhood educators should engage in ongoing cultural competence to support cultural diversity and inclusion in their daily professional practice. This involves building relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities, recognizing the impact of the land, and being respectful of cultural practices. Additionally, early childhood educators can embrace traditional stories, songs, and dances from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and incorporate them into the learning environment to promote cultural inclusivity. Further, understanding the significance of Country, Dreaming stories, and traditional knowledge among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples can foster strong cultural bonds with the children and their families(Department of Education, Skills and Employment, 2019). In conclusion, early childhood educators must be aware of the NQS's focus on educational program and practice as it provides a professional framework for ensuring quality outcomes for children. Building positive and collaborative relationships with families and communities, respecting and including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures, and promoting diversity are critical aspects of delivering high-quality early childhood education and care. By adhering to the NQS, early childhood educators can establish a strong foundation of respect, dignity, equity, diversity, cultural responsiveness, and inclusion and promote positive outcomes for children, families, and the community.
